## Competency
> Learn how to apply database systems concepts and principles to develop client/server applications that interface client-side code with databases. Develop an application that integrates with current and emerging technologies in an effective and efficient manner. 

## Scenario :memo:


## Reflection :pencil2:	
To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I ensure that the code was up to high standards such as in the areas of industry best practices. Additionally, utilizing encapsulation assisted in constructing code that would be readable, repeatable, and adaptable. The advantages of working with CRUD is that the developer can balance the various operations that are needed to take place for the database that was in Project One. To add on, CRUD is essential to implementing a database application. 

As a computer scientist, I believe that approaching a problem needs exceptional attention to detail and critical analysis into the issue at hand. Such as my approach to the database and dashbaord requirments that Grazioso Salvare requested, I had utilize tools such as pymongo, jupyter notebook, and mongoDB. These tools not only made the process of building the project run smooth but also helped in ensuring that the expected outcome would result in a success. My approach for this project differed from previous assignments in past courses because I had to implement the CRUD operation as well as using the Mongo module to query the database. Additionally, with this project, it was vital to work on each principle of the CRUD method each week. This helped when it came to unit tests beecause it provided me with more time to integrate different structures for each CRUD functionality as well as ensuring that the minute details are up to standards. I would most definitely use the CRUD method in the future to create databases to meet other client requests. I also enjoyed how this project gave me a feel for real world scenarios. 

Computer scientists are unique individuals that provide a specific expertise in the tech industry. Though this can be a very broad statement, computer scientists are the true brains behind technology. What they do, matters, because their work goes unnoticed especially when it comes to business functions. They play a major role in businesses running and without them business structures can crumble. My work on this type of project can help a company to do their work better because the companies and  team members can efficiently benefit from data being found fast and effectively.
