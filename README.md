### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I ensured that the code was up to high standards such as in the areas of industry best practices. Additionally, utilizing encapsulation assisted in construcgting code that would be readable, repeatable, and adaptable. The advantages of working with CRUD is that the developer can balance the various operations that are needed to take place for the database that was in Project One. To add on, CRUD is essential to implementing a database application. 

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, I believe that approaching a problem needs much attention to detail and critical analysis into the issue at hand. Such as my approach to the database and dashbaord requirments that Grazioso Salvare requested, I had utilize tools such pymongo, jupyter notebook, and mongoDB. These tools not only made the process of building the project smooth but also helped in ensuring that the expected outcome would result in a success. My approach for this project differed from previous assignments in past courses because I had to implement the CRUD operation as well as using the Mongo module to query the database. Additionally, with this project, it was vital to split each portion of the CRUD each week. This helped a ton when it came to unit tests beecause it provided me with more time to integrate different structures for each CRUD function as well as ensuring that the minute details are up to standards. I would most definitely use the CRUD operation in the future to create databases to meet other client requests. I enjoyed how this project gave me a feel for real world scenario. 

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists are unique individuals that provide a specific expertise in the tech industry. Though this can be a very broad statement, computer scientists are the true brains behind technology. What they do matters because their work goes unnoticed especially when it comes to business functions. They play a major role in businesses running and without them business structures can crumble. My work on this type of project can help a company to do their work better because the companies and  team members can efficiently benefit from data being found fast and effectively.
